<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

WordBuddy is a Telegram bot built to support language learners by generating contextual example sentences and audio for any user-provided word. It was created with a specific goal in mind: to simplify the process of making high-quality Anki flashcards.

Anki is a powerful tool for memorization, especially when used with sentence-based learning instead of isolated vocabulary. Learning new words in context helps reinforce meaning, grammar, and usage ‚Äî all at once. However, creating example sentences and generating pronunciation audio manually can be time-consuming and tedious. That's where WordBuddy steps in.

With WordBuddy, you simply send a word to the bot, and it returns:

    üìú A natural, contextual sentence using the word

    üîä A clear audio pronunciation of the sentence

This makes it incredibly easy to copy everything directly into your Anki deck ‚Äî no need to research examples or create audio files yourself.

Whether you‚Äôre learning a new language from scratch or expanding your vocabulary, WordBuddy helps you streamline your workflow and focus on what really matters: meaningful, effective learning.
